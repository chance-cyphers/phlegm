### Goals

Make it easier for devs to rapidly create, change, and communicate REST API design

### Anti-goals

Help consumers to use said API

### Other

Postman does a good job of designing the request, but not the response

Swagger does a good job of helping users to view/use an existing api, but doesn't much help the creative process
