### Goals

Make it easier for devs to rapidly create, change, and communicate REST API design

### Anti-goals

Help consumers to use said API

### Other

Postman does a good job of designing the request, but not the response

Swagger does a good job of helping users to view/use an existing api, but doesn't much help the creative process

Maybe a way to view "flows", not just static resources/endpoints
  - flows might be a great tie-in for generated tests

The api design should be source controlled, with diffs that are easy to understand. Either simple underlying data structure or maybe even an app feature?
  - Leverage git for API versioning?

A place to document design decisions

Real big REST theme
  - stupid startup tips
